# The Stop Watch Code Along
- Build an application that has the following visual components
    - A div with some HH:mm:ss.SSS formatted time
    - a button that when clicked start the watch and updates the div every millisecond
    - a button to stop (pause) the clock
    - a button to reset the timer and reset the app
    - a button to record a lap
    - a list of laps with an identifier and a time stamp
- The application doesn't need to have any style
- Good practice can be followed through out coding this
